# Complete README Redesign - Deep Research & DX Excellence

## Mission

You are tasked with **completely redesigning the README** for `@dao/vibe-check`, a Vitest-based testing framework for Claude Code agents. This is **documentation-driven development**: the README you design will become the authoritative specification that drives implementation.

Your mission is to create the **best possible developer experience** through deep research, analysis, and thoughtful design. This is not about options—deliver your **single best recommendation** backed by research and reasoning.

## What is vibe-check?

`@dao/vibe-check` is an **automation and evaluation framework** built on Vitest + Claude Code that allows developers to:

### Dual Purpose: Automation + Evaluation

**As an Automation Suite:**
1. **Run agent workflows as pipelines** - Execute multi-step automations
2. **Orchestrate multiple agents** - Chain tasks together
3. **Production-grade reporting** - Get detailed metrics on every run
4. **Built on Vitest** - Leverage mature test infrastructure for automation

**As an Evaluation Framework:**
1. **Benchmark agent performance** - Compare models, configs, prompts
2. **Matrix test workflows** - Same task, multiple configs, parallel execution
3. **Track costs and quality** - Custom matchers and LLM-based judges
4. **Ensure quality gates** - Validate agent outputs before deployment

### The Killer Feature: Rich Reporting

Whether you're automating or evaluating, you get:
- **Terminal reporting** - Cost tracking, summaries, metrics
- **HTML reporting** - Rich transcripts, tool timelines, todo tracking
- **Detailed metrics** - Tool calls, costs, duration, token usage
- **Artifact capture** - Diffs, logs, outputs automatically saved

**Built on Vitest v3** with streaming Claude Agent SDK integration.

**Target users**: Developers building agent automations and those who need to validate/benchmark Claude Code workflows.

## Current State - Context Files

### Problems Identified
**File**: `/Users/abuusama/repos/vibe-check/.claude/docs/vibecheck/readme-problems.mdx`

Four major problems with current README:
1. ✅ **SOLVED**: Missing prompt builder API (now documented)
2. ❌ **UNSOLVED**: No agent builder/extension pattern
3. ❌ **UNSOLVED**: Unclear project/source workflow & worktree management
4. ✅ **MOSTLY SOLVED**: Matrix testing (but could be clearer)

### Current README
**File**: `/Users/abuusama/repos/vibe-check/README.md`

Current structure:
- Quick Start
- Prompt Builder API (newly added)
- Common Testing Scenarios
- Matrix Testing
- Assertions & Matchers
- LLM-Based Evaluation
- Reporters
- Example Use Cases

**Strengths**: Good examples, comprehensive matchers, shows LLM judges
**Weaknesses**: No agent config, unclear isolation model, missing project source handling

### Implementation Plan
**File**: `/Users/abuusama/repos/vibe-check/.claude/docs/vibecheck/implementation-plan.mdx`

Technical details:
- Vitest fixtures (runAgent, judge, artifacts, metrics)
- Agent runner with Claude SDK streaming
- Cost/HTML reporters
- Matrix generation via `defineTestSuite`
- Rubric-based evaluation

**Key insight**: Implementation exists but DX story is incomplete

### Code Skeleton
**File**: `/Users/abuusama/repos/vibe-check/.claude/docs/vibecheck/code_skel.mdx`

Shows actual TypeScript interfaces:
- `RunAgentInput` (lines 217-226) - current API
- `AgentRunner` class (lines 421-537) - implementation
- Fixture setup (lines 300-326)

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Documentation-Driven Development
The README **IS** the spec. Implementation follows documentation, not vice versa.

### 2. DX-First Philosophy
Developer experience trumps implementation convenience. Design the API developers **want**, then figure out how to build it.

### 3. API Surface Only - No Implementation Details
**CRITICAL**: Focus exclusively on the **API surface** and **developer experience**.

**DO NOT explain:**
- How git worktrees work under the hood
- Internal implementation mechanisms
- How things are built internally
- Technical internals of Claude SDK

**DO explain:**
- What the API looks like
- How developers use it
- What they can achieve
- What behaviors to expect

The goal is **best possible UX/DX**, not technical education about internals.

### 4. Progressive Complexity
- Simple cases: 1-2 lines, zero config
- Medium cases: Explicit but straightforward
- Advanced cases: Full control when needed

### 5. Learn from the Best
Study and synthesize patterns from:
- Testing frameworks: Vitest, Playwright, Jest
- Agent frameworks: LangChain, AutoGPT, Semantic Kernel
- DX excellence: Stripe, Vercel, Railway

## Research Mandate

3. **Code Examples**: Real, runnable TypeScript
4. **Callouts**: Tips, warnings, important notes
5. **Links**: Internal navigation, external resources

### Critical Decisions to Make

**You must design and justify:**

1. **Agent API**: How do developers define and use agents?
   ```typescript
   // What does this look like?
   const agent = ???
   await runAgent({ prompt, agent })
   ```

2. **Project Source API**: How do developers specify where to run?
   ```typescript
   // Git repo? Local dir? Temp workspace?
   project: ???
   ```

3. **Custom Commands**: How do developers add custom commands?
   ```typescript
   // How is this defined and registered?
   commands: { '/my-command': ??? }
   ```

4. **Default Behaviors**: What happens with zero config?
   ```typescript
   // What workspace? What tools? What isolation?
   await runAgent({ prompt: prompt('test') })
   ```

5. **Information Architecture**: What order should concepts be taught?

## Output Format

### Part 1: Research Summary (500-1000 words)

Synthesize your research:
- Key insights from testing frameworks
- Key insights from agent frameworks
- Key insights from DX excellence
- Patterns you're adopting
- Patterns you're avoiding (and why)

### Part 2: Design Decisions (Critical Choices)

For each major API decision:
- **Decision**: What you're proposing
- **Alternatives considered**: What else you looked at
- **Rationale**: Why this is the best choice
- **Research backing**: What research supports this

Example:
```markdown
**Decision: Agent Definition Pattern**
- **Proposed**: `defineAgent({ name, project, tools, commands })`
- **Alternatives**: Builder pattern, class-based, fixture extension
- **Rationale**: Object config matches Vitest patterns, reusable, no ceremony
- **Research**: Vitest uses object configs, LangChain uses similar pattern
```

### Part 3: Complete README ⭐ THE FINAL DELIVERABLE

**THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART.**

Provide the **full README in markdown** that will become the authoritative specification.

**Focus on:**
- ✅ API surface and developer experience
- ✅ How to use the framework
- ✅ What developers can achieve
- ✅ Code examples (real, compilable TypeScript)
- ✅ Progressive learning journey

**Do NOT include:**
- ❌ Implementation details (how git worktrees work internally)
- ❌ Technical architecture explanations
- ❌ Internal mechanisms
- ❌ "How we built this" content

**Format:**
- All sections written out (or detailed outlines for longer sections)
- Real code examples (compilable TypeScript)
- Proper markdown formatting, callouts, tables
- Internal links for navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Inline tips, warnings, notes where helpful

**Remember:** This README is the spec. It should read like documentation for a finished product, even though implementation hasn't started yet. Focus on the **developer's perspective**: what they see, what they use, what they achieve.

## Success Criteria

Your README redesign should:

✅ **Be immediately understandable** - Junior dev should "get it" in 5 minutes
✅ **Communicate dual purpose** - Automation AND evaluation, both equally important
✅ **Showcase reporting** - Make rich reporting the obvious killer feature
✅ **Scale to complexity** - Advanced users find everything they need
✅ **Show, don't tell** - Code examples before explanations
✅ **Solve all 4 problems** - Agent config, project sources, matrix testing, prompts
✅ **API surface only** - Zero implementation details, pure DX focus
✅ **Be Vitest-idiomatic** - Feels like natural Vitest extension
✅ **Enable reusability** - Agents/prompts easily shared across tests/automations
✅ **Explain isolation** - Concept is clear (high-level), not implementation details
✅ **Inspire confidence** - Developers trust this will work
✅ **Production-ready tone** - Reads like docs for a shipped product

## Constraints & Non-Negotiables

1. **Must use Vitest fixtures** - No custom test runners
2. **Prompt ≠ Agent** - These must be separate concepts
3. **No user extension needed** - `vibeTest` works out of the box
4. **Array = Matrix dimension** - Simple matrix syntax
5. **TypeScript-first** - Excellent type inference and autocomplete

## Methodology

1. **Read all context files** thoroughly
2. **Research extensively** - Don't skip this, it's your superpower
3. **Analyze patterns** - What works? What doesn't?
4. **Design APIs** - TypeScript interfaces first
5. **Write examples** - Realistic, compelling use cases
6. **Draft README** - Complete, production-ready
7. **Validate** - Check against success criteria
8. **Refine** - Polish until it's excellent

## Final Note

This is **the most important document** in the entire project. The README you create will:

- Guide implementation for months
- Determine adoption and success
- Define the developer experience
- Establish the framework's identity

### Critical Reminders

**1. Dual Purpose is Essential**
Don't position this as "just a testing framework." It's equally:
- An **automation tool** for running agent workflows in production
- An **evaluation framework** for benchmarking and quality gates

Both use cases benefit from the **killer feature: rich reporting**.

**2. Reporting is the Secret Weapon**
Make it crystal clear that whether you're automating OR evaluating, you get:
- Detailed terminal summaries
- Beautiful HTML reports with transcripts
- Complete metrics on every run
This is what makes vibe-check special.

**3. API Surface Only**
The README should be 100% about "what can I do" and 0% about "how it works internally."
- Show the API
- Explain the behavior
- Skip the implementation details

**4. The Deliverable is Just the README**
Your output is a production-ready README in markdown. Not:
- Implementation specs
- Architecture diagrams
- Technical deep-dives
- Internal mechanism explanations

Just: A beautiful, clear, inspiring README that developers want to use.

---

**Take your time. Do deep research. Think critically. Deliver excellence.**

Your deliverable is not "options" - it's your **single best recommendation**, backed by research, reasoning, and deep understanding of what makes great developer tools.

Go create something exceptional.
