# Task: Add Loading State to Submit Button

## Context

The submit button currently doesn't provide visual feedback when a form is being submitted, leading to user confusion and potential duplicate submissions.

## Current State

Submit button has no loading indication. Users can click multiple times during form submission, potentially causing race conditions or duplicate requests.

## Requirements

1. Add loading state (spinner/disabled state) to submit button during form submission
2. Disable button to prevent multiple clicks
3. Show appropriate loading indicator (spinner or text change)
4. Re-enable button after submission completes (success or error)
5. Maintain accessibility (screen reader announcements)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Have âœ…
- [ ] Button shows loading state when form is submitting
- [ ] Button is disabled during submission
- [ ] Button re-enables after submission completes
- [ ] Loading indicator is visually clear
- [ ] Accessible to screen readers (aria-busy, aria-label updates)
- [ ] Works on both success and error cases

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add `isLoading` state to form component
- [ ] Update button to show spinner when `isLoading` is true
- [ ] Add `disabled={isLoading}` to button
- [ ] Set `isLoading` to true on form submit
- [ ] Set `isLoading` to false in success/error callbacks
- [ ] Add appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-busy`, `aria-label`)
- [ ] Test with keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test with screen reader

## Success Verification

After implementation, verify:

1. Button shows loading spinner when clicked
2. Button cannot be clicked again while loading
3. Button returns to normal state after success
4. Button returns to normal state after error
5. Screen reader announces loading state
6. Keyboard users can't submit multiple times

## Final Notes

Consider using existing spinner component if available. Ensure the loading state doesn't block error messages from displaying to the user.
