## Phase 0: Risk Assessment & Spikes (Week 1)

**Goal**: Identify and de-risk highest-risk components

### Risk Assessment Workshop
- [x] Facilitate risk assessment workshop with team (4 hours)
- [x] Create risk matrix with scores
- [x] Prioritize top 6 risks
- [x] Create spike plans for top 3 risks
- [x] Document in RISK_ASSESSMENT.md

### Spike 1: Hook Capture System (Risk Score: 9)
- [x] Set up spike environment (`spikes/01-hook-capture/`)
- [x] Build minimal hook listener
- [x] Test with real Claude SDK execution
- [x] Measure performance overhead
- [x] Document learnings in LEARNINGS.md
- [x] Document performance benchmarks

**Questions to Answer**:
- Can we capture hooks non-blocking?
- What temp file strategy works best?
- How do we handle write failures?
- When should we clean up temp files?

### Spike 2: SDK Integration (Risk Score: 8)
- [x] Set up spike environment (`spikes/02-sdk-integration/`)
- [x] Build minimal SDK bridge layer
- [x] Prototype recorder (capture SDK calls)
- [x] Prototype replayer (replay from fixtures)
- [x] Test deterministic replay
- [x] Document learnings in LEARNINGS.md

**Questions to Answer**:
- What SDK methods do we need?
- What recording format works best?
- How do we handle timing/randomness in replay?
- Can we version recordings by SDK semver?

### Spike 3: Tool Call Correlation (Risk Score: 7)
- [x] Set up spike environment (`spikes/03-correlation/`)
- [x] Build minimal correlation algorithm
- [x] Create test cases (normal, missing PostToolUse, concurrent calls)
- [x] Test with sample hook data
- [x] Benchmark performance
- [x] Document learnings in LEARNINGS.md

**Questions to Answer**:
- What correlation strategy works best?
- How do we handle missing PostToolUse?
- Can we handle concurrent tool calls?
- What's the performance characteristic (O(n) vs O(n¬≤))?

### Spike Learnings Summary
- [x] Aggregate learnings from all spikes
- [x] Document key insights in `spikes/LEARNINGS_SUMMARY.md`
- [x] Identify any new risks or blockers
- [x] Update Phase 1 plan based on learnings
