   - How to actually use this system
   - Command workflows

---

## üöÄ Getting Started (First Session)

### Step 1: Read the Technical Specifications

Located in `.claude/docs/vibecheck/`:
- `technical-specification.md` (3,376 lines) - Complete technical design
- `testing-specification.md` (2,700 lines) - Testing strategy

**Time**: 2-3 hours (skim for now, deep read during relevant phases)

### Step 2: Understand the Architecture

Read the RADIAL_MAP.md for visual architecture:
- `RADIAL_MAP.md` - Kernel ‚Üí Rings dependency visualization

**Key Concepts**:
- 9 domains: Core Testing, Agent Execution, Storage, Judge, Reporters, Hook Capture, File Tracking, Config, Matrix Testing
- Dependency layers: Kernel ‚Üí Ring 1 ‚Üí Ring 2 ‚Üí Ring 3 ‚Üí Ring 4
- Independence matrix: Which components can be built first (see RADIAL_MAP.md)

**Time**: 30 minutes

### Step 3: Review the Implementation Strategy

Read `IMPLEMENTATION_STRATEGY.md` (this is THE master plan)

**Key Points**:
- Hybrid approach: Spike high-risk components first, then radial expansion
- 5 phases over 8 weeks
- Clear parallelization strategy

**Time**: 30 minutes

### Step 4: Set Up Your Environment

```bash
cd /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/vibetest-implementation

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
bun install

# Verify setup
bun test  # Should run (no tests yet)
bun run build # Should build (minimal setup)
```

## üìÖ Phase 0: Risk Assessment & Spikes (Week 1)

### Session 1: Risk Assessment Workshop (4 hours)

**Goal**: Identify and prioritize risks

**Activities**:
1. Review `RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` together
2. Discuss each high-risk component
3. Assign spikes to team members
4. Schedule spike time blocks

**Output**: Finalized risk matrix, spike assignments

### Sessions 2-4: Execute Spikes (6-8 hours each)

**Spike 1: Hook Capture System** (Risk Score: 9)
- Assigned To: [Name/Pair]
- Time Box: 6-8 hours
- Goal: Prove hooks can be captured non-blocking

**Spike 2: SDK Integration** (Risk Score: 8)
- Assigned To: [Name/Pair]
- Time Box: 6-8 hours
- Goal: Build recorder/replayer prototype

**Spike 3: Tool Call Correlation** (Risk Score: 7)
- Assigned To: [Name/Pair]
- Time Box: 4-6 hours
- Goal: Validate correlation algorithm

**Run these spikes in parallel!**

### Session 5: Spike Review (2-3 hours)

**Goal**: Aggregate learnings, decide go/no-go for Phase 1

**Activities**:
1. Each spike presents findings
2. Fill out `spikes/LEARNINGS_SUMMARY.md`
3. Update `RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` with new scores
4. Decide: Proceed to Phase 1?

**Output**: Go/no-go decision, updated Phase 1 plan

---

## üìù Using the Session Template

For every session, use the template:

```bash
cp .claude/tasks/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md .claude/tasks/SESSION_LOG/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-[component].md
```

Fill it out as you work:
1. **Before**: Goals, pre-session checklist
2. **During**: What we did, challenges
3. **After**: Learnings, next steps, update progress

---

## üîÑ Session Workflow

Every session should follow this pattern:

### 1. Start of Session (5 min)
```bash
# Read current status
cat PROGRESS.md | grep "Phase 0"

# Check spike status
cat spikes/OVERVIEW.md
```

### 2. Work (3-6 hours)
- Write tests first (TDD)
- Implement
- Document as you go

### 3. End of Session (15 min)
```bash
# Update progress
vim PROGRESS.md  # Check off completed tasks

# Update test matrix
vim TEST_MATRIX.md  # Update coverage

# Create session log
vim SESSION_LOG/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-spike-1.md

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "[Phase 0] Complete Spike 1: Hook Capture"
git push
```

---

## üìä Tracking Progress

### Daily

1. Update `PROGRESS.md` - Check off completed tasks
2. Create `SESSION_LOG/{date}-{component}.md` - Session notes
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages

### Weekly

1. Review `PROGRESS.md` - Overall status
2. Update `TEST_MATRIX.md` - Coverage metrics
3. Team standup - Blockers, learnings, next week

### End of Phase

1. Update phase/ring `OVERVIEW.md` - Phase completion status
2. Integration session - Test cross-component integration
3. Retrospective - What worked, what didn't

## üéì Key Concepts

### Spikes
- Time-boxed prototypes (4-8 hours)
- Goal: Learn, not ship
- Code is throwaway

### Kernel
- Stable foundation (types, schemas, utils, SDK bridge)
- Immutable after Phase 1
- Zero internal dependencies

### Rings
- Concentric layers of functionality
- Ring 1: Storage, Agent, Git
- Ring 2: vibeTest, vibeWorkflow, Matchers
- Ring 3: Judge, Reporters
- Ring 4: Matrix Testing, Config, Docs

### TDD Cycle
- üî¥ Red: Write failing test
- üü¢ Green: Make test pass
- üîµ Refactor: Clean up code
- Repeat

---

## üÜò Getting Help

### Blocked?

1. Document blocker in `SESSION_LOG/{date}.md`
2. Add to `PROGRESS.md` under "Blockers & Issues"
3. Discuss with team
4. Update spike plan or risk assessment if needed

### Questions?

1. Check technical specifications first
2. Review spike learnings (if applicable)
3. Ask in team Slack channel
4. Document answer for future reference
