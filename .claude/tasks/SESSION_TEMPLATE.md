## Session Information

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Phase**: [Phase Name]
**Component**: [Component Name]
**Duration**: [X hours]
**Participants**: [Names]

---

## Session Goals

_What do we want to accomplish in this session?_

- [ ] Goal 1
- [ ] Goal 2
- [ ] Goal 3

---

## Pre-Session Checklist

- [ ] Read `PROGRESS.md` - Check overall status
- [ ] Read current phase/ring `OVERVIEW.md` - Check phase status
- [ ] Review dependencies in `RADIAL_MAP.md` or `ring{N}/CONTRACTS.md`
- [ ] Check for blockers in previous session logs
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Pull latest code

---

## Session Plan

### 1. Write Failing Tests (30 min)

**Tests to write**:
```typescript
// List specific tests you'll write
describe('[Component]', () => {
  it('[test case 1]');
  it('[test case 2]');
  it('[test case 3]');
});
```

**Test files**:
- `tests/unit/[path]/[file].test.ts`
- `tests/integration/[path]/[file].test.ts`

### 2. Implementation (2-3 hours)

**Files to create/modify**:
- `src/[path]/[file].ts`
- `src/[path]/[file2].ts`

**Approach**:
1. Step 1: [Description]
2. Step 2: [Description]
3. Step 3: [Description]

**TDD Cycle**:
- üî¥ Red: Write failing test
- üü¢ Green: Make test pass (minimal code)
- üîµ Refactor: Clean up code
- Repeat

### 3. Documentation (30 min)

**Documents to update**:
- [ ] `PROGRESS.md` - Check off completed tasks
- [ ] `TEST_MATRIX.md` - Update coverage
- [ ] `ring{N}/OVERVIEW.md` - Update component status
- [ ] Component API docs (if applicable)
- [ ] Code comments (if complex logic)

## Template Usage Notes

### For Spike Sessions (Phase 0)

- Focus less on "Tests Written" (spikes are prototypes)
- Focus more on "Learnings" and "Questions Answered"
- Add section: "Spike Success Criteria Met?" (Yes/No + explanation)

### For Kernel Sessions (Phase 1)

- Emphasize API stability (kernel shouldn't change)
- Document API contracts thoroughly
- Add section: "Breaking Changes?" (should be none)

### For Ring Sessions (Phase 2-5)

- Focus on integration with other spokes
- Document cross-spoke dependencies
- Add section: "Integration Test Results"

### For Integration Sessions (End of Ring)

- Focus on cross-component integration
- Document integration issues discovered
- Update ring-level `INTEGRATION.md`
