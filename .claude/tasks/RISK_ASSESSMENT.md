**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Conducted By**: [Team]
**Status**: Initial Assessment

## Risk Scoring Methodology

**Risk Score = Complexity Ã— Uncertainty Ã— (Impact / 10)**

- **Complexity**: How hard is it to implement correctly? (1-3 scale)
  - 1 = Low (straightforward, well-understood patterns)
  - 2 = Medium (some complexity, requires careful design)
  - 3 = High (very complex, many edge cases)

- **Uncertainty**: Do we understand the requirements/approach? (1-3 scale)
  - 1 = Low (clear requirements, proven approach)
  - 2 = Medium (some unknowns, need validation)
  - 3 = High (many unknowns, needs research)

- **Impact**: How many other components depend on this? (1-10 scale)
  - 1-3 = Low (few dependencies)
  - 4-7 = Medium (moderate dependencies)
  - 8-10 = High (critical foundation, many dependencies)

## High-Risk Components (Require Spikes)

### 1. Hook Capture System (Updated Risk Score: 5.4)

**Spike Outcome**
- Non-blocking NDJSON capture implemented with in-memory queue + stream back-pressure.
- Benchmark: 5â€¯000 events captured in 82â€¯ms (â‰ˆ1.6â€¯% overhead vs 5â€¯s run).
- Failure path exercised via simulated disk error (`onWriteError`), confirming graceful shutdown/degradation.

**Residual Risk**
- Requires production hardening around multi-process cleanup and telemetry.
- Still depends on upstream hooks providing consistent timestamps.

**Next Steps**
- Promote capture session into the kernel with metrics (queue depth, bytes written).
- Add manifest-driven cleanup to avoid temp file leaks in crash scenarios.

---

### 2. SDK Integration (Updated Risk Score: 4.8)

**Spike Outcome**
- Bridge dynamically selects real SDK or local stub (default stub without API keys).
- Recorder persists complete message streams (JSON + NDJSON) including semver + timing metadata.
- Replayer yields deterministic sequences; fixtures generated for regression tests.

**Residual Risk**
- Real SDK parity still needs validation (networked integration test).
- Version mismatch detection is advisory in the prototypeâ€”must become a hard guardrail.

**Next Steps**
- Flesh out production API (`recordQueryTo`, `replayFixture`) backed by these prototypes.
- Add integrity hash + SDK version check before replaying fixtures in CI.

---

### 3. Tool Call Correlation (Updated Risk Score: 3.6)

**Spike Outcome**
- FIFO queue correlator matches pre/post events using `toolInvocationId` (with session/tool fallback).
- Handles out-of-order delivery and missing counterparts by surfacing `missing-post` and `orphan-post`.
- Benchmark on 2â€¯000 tool calls completes in 8.53â€¯ms (â‰ˆ4.26â€¯Âµs per call).

**Residual Risk**
- Relies on upstream instrumentation to emit stable invocation IDs; fallback keys can collide in pathological scenarios.
- Needs guardrails around memory usage if thousands of concurrent invocations queue up.

**Next Steps**
- Enforce ID generation at hook emission time to avoid fallback collisions.
- Add the benchmark to CI to monitor regression in complexity or runtime.

## Medium-Risk Components (Monitor, No Spike Required)

### 4. Content-Addressed Storage (Risk Score: 4.8)

**Mitigation**:
- Use proven SHA-256 hashing
- Standard deduplication pattern
- Benchmark early to catch performance issues

### 5. LLM Judge Parsing (Risk Score: 4.8)

**Mitigation**:
- Design robust prompt format
- Use structured output (JSON)
- Graceful fallback for parsing failures
- Test with multiple rubric formats early

### 6. Reactive Watchers (Risk Score: 4.8)

**Mitigation**:
- Use standard thenable pattern
- Sequential execution (simpler than parallel)
- Clear abort semantics

---

## Low-Risk Components (Standard Patterns)

### 7-12. HTML Reporting, Lazy Loading, Git, vibeTest, Matrix, Config

**Mitigation**:
- Follow standard patterns
- Use existing libraries where possible
- Comprehensive tests to catch issues early
