   - Missing SDKUserMessage Type Import
   - prompt() Return Type Mismatch
   - Circular Dependency in Helper Functions

2. **Batch 2: Missing Core Implementations** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - ContextManager missing methods
   - Judge helper functions incomplete
   - Git detection logic missing

3. **Batch 3: API Consistency** üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY
   - runAgent() contradictory return types
   - Workspace precedence unclear
   - hookCaptureStatus never populated

4. **Batch 4: Structural Improvements** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - DEFAULT_MODEL location
   - AgentConfig duplication
   - MCP examples in wrong section

## Work Flow

For each batch:

1. **Read tracking document** to see batch details
2. **Read audit report** for specific issue context
3. **Fix issues** in the technical specification
4. **Update spec version** (v1.4-beta.1, beta.2, etc.)
5. **Mark complete** in tracking document
6. **Get approval** before next batch

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 8 critical blockers resolved
- [ ] All 12 consistency issues resolved
- [ ] All 9 documentation gaps addressed (or deferred to Phase 3)
- [ ] Specification updated to v1.4.1 (or v1.5)
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Ready for implementation

---

## Notes

- **START WITH BATCH 1** - Type conflicts block everything else
- Work incrementally with user approval between batches
- Use beta versions during work (v1.4-beta.1, etc.)
- Final version only after all critical batches complete
- Documentation gaps can be deferred to Phase 3 if needed

---

## Output Format

After each batch completion, provide:
1. Summary of changes made
2. Sections modified
3. Version updated to
4. Items checked off in tracking doc
5. Request approval before proceeding to next batch
