# Git Worktree & Tmux Manager

Ultra-efficient wrapper for `scripts/wt.ts` - loads state once, executes fast.

## Your Task

**Step 1: Load current state (single call)**

Run this command to get all worktree/tmux state:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts debug
```

Store the output in `<current-state>` for reference.

**Step 2: Execute the requested command**

Based on the user's subcommand (`$1`), execute the appropriate action:

### For read-only commands (status, list, debug):
- **Display the output from Step 1 directly** (already have all data)
- Format appropriately if needed

### For mutating commands (create, delete, cleanup, open):
- Run: `cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts $@`
- Display output directly

**Why this approach?**
- ‚úÖ Single upfront call gathers all state
- ‚úÖ No sequential bash calls for read operations
- ‚úÖ Reuses cached data when possible
- ‚úÖ Only executes script when actually needed

<execution-rules>
## Command Routing

| User Input | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `/wt` or `/wt status` | Parse `<current-state>`, format status view |
| `/wt list` | Parse `<current-state>`, format list view |
| `/wt debug` | Show raw `<current-state>` output |
| `/wt create <branch>` | Execute: `bun scripts/wt.ts create <branch> [path]` |
| `/wt open <target>` | Execute: `bun scripts/wt.ts open <target>` |
| `/wt cleanup` | Execute: `bun scripts/wt.ts cleanup [-y]` |
| `/wt delete <id>` | Execute: `bun scripts/wt.ts delete <id> [-y]` |
| `/wt delete-all` | Execute: `bun scripts/wt.ts delete-all [-y]` |

## IMPORTANT: Understanding `cleanup` vs `delete`

**`cleanup` does NOT delete all worktrees!** It only removes orphaned/stale items:
- Tmux windows without matching worktrees
- Worktrees without matching tmux windows
- Missing or broken symlinks

**To delete all worktrees and start fresh:**

**Option 1: Use `delete-all` (recommended)**
```bash
/wt delete-all -y  # Deletes all non-main worktrees in one command
```

**Option 2: Delete individually**
1. First, list all worktrees: `/wt list`
2. Delete each one: `/wt delete <branch-name> -y`
3. Then create new ones: `/wt create <new-branch>`

**Example: Reset for new spike work**
```bash
# Wrong approach:
/wt cleanup -y  # This won't delete existing worktrees!

# Correct approach (recommended):
/wt delete-all -y
/wt create spike/hook-capture
/wt create spike/sdk-integration
/wt create spike/tool-call-correlation

# Alternative (manual):
/wt delete spike/hook-capture -y
/wt delete spike/sdk-integration -y
/wt delete spike/tool-call-correlation -y
/wt create spike/hook-capture
/wt create spike/sdk-integration
/wt create spike/tool-call-correlation
```

## Formatting Rules

When displaying status/list from cached data:
- Use the same visual format as the script's native output
- Keep emojis, colors, and structure consistent
- Extract and display relevant fields from `<current-state>`
</execution-rules>

<examples>
## Example 1: Status Command (Uses Cached Data)

<input>/wt status</input>

<process>
1. Load state once:
   ```bash
   cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts debug
   ```

2. Parse output to extract:
   - Repository name
   - Current branch
   - Current path
   - Session exists?
   - Current window
   - Worktree count
   - Window count
   - Sync status

3. Format and display (no additional bash calls needed)
</process>

<expected_output>
üìä Worktree Manager Status

Repository: vibe-check
Current Branch: main
Current Path: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/main

Tmux Session: vibe-check (exists)
Current Window: 2:spike/hook-capture

Worktrees: 6 total
Tmux Windows: 6 total
Status: ‚úì Synchronized

Quick Actions:
  create <branch>     Create new worktree
  list                List all worktrees
  open <target>       Switch to window
  cleanup             Clean up orphaned items
  delete <id>         Delete worktree and window
</expected_output>
</example>

## Example 2: List Command (Uses Cached Data)

<input>/wt list</input>

<process>
1. Already have state from initial load
2. Parse worktrees and windows from `<current-state>`
3. Match them by path
4. Format list view
</process>

<expected_output>
üìã Worktree List

Repository: vibe-check
Tmux Session: vibe-check (exists)

WORKTREES (6 total):

1. main
   Path: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/main
   Tmux: 1:zsh ‚úì synced

2. spike/hook-capture
   Path: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/hook-capture
   Tmux: 2:spike/hook-capture ‚úì synced

[... etc ...]

Summary: 6 worktrees, 6 tmux windows
</expected_output>
</example>

## Example 3: Create Command (Executes Script)

<input>/wt create feature/auth</input>

<process>
Execute directly:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts create feature/auth
```
</process>

<expected_output>
‚úì Created worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/auth
‚úì Created tmux window: vibe-check:7 (feature/auth)
‚úì Switched to new window
</expected_output>
</example>

## Example 4: Open Command (Executes Script)

<input>/wt open hook</input>

<process>
Execute directly:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts open hook
```
</process>

<expected_output>
‚úì Switched to window: vibe-check:2 (spike/hook-capture)
</expected_output>
</example>

## Example 5: Cleanup Command (Executes Script)

<input>/wt cleanup -y</input>

<process>
Execute directly:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts cleanup -y
```

**Note:** This only removes orphaned items (tmux windows without worktrees, worktrees without windows).
It does NOT delete all worktrees. See "Understanding cleanup vs delete" section above.
</process>

<expected_output>
üßπ Cleanup Report:
Stale Worktrees: 0 removed
Orphaned Windows: 0 closed
Missing Windows: 2 created
Path Issues: 0 detected
‚úì Cleanup complete
</expected_output>
</example>

## Example 6: Delete All Non-Main Worktrees

<input>/wt delete-all -y</input>

<process>
Execute directly:
```bash
cd "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" && bun scripts/wt.ts delete-all -y
```

This command:
1. Lists all non-main worktrees
2. Shows what will be deleted
3. Confirms deletion (skipped with -y flag)
4. Deletes each worktree and closes corresponding tmux windows
</process>

<expected_output>
‚ö†Ô∏è  The following worktrees will be deleted:
  - issue/24 @ /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/24
  - spike/hook-capture @ /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/hook-capture
  - spike/sdk-integration @ /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/sdk-integration
  - spike/tool-call-correlation @ /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/tool-call-correlation
  - feat/vibetest-implementation-plan @ /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/vibetest-implementation

‚úì Closed tmux window: vibe-check:3 (issue/24)
‚úì Removed worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/24
‚úì Closed tmux window: vibe-check:2 (spike/hook-capture)
‚úì Removed worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/hook-capture
‚úì Closed tmux window: vibe-check:4 (spike/sdk-integration)
‚úì Removed worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/sdk-integration
‚úì Closed tmux window: vibe-check:5 (spike/tool-call-correlation)
‚úì Removed worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/tool-call-correlation
‚úì Closed tmux window: vibe-check:6 (feat/vibetest-implementation-plan)
‚úì Removed worktree: /Users/abuusama/repos/worktrees/vibe-check/vibetest-implementation

üßπ Delete All Complete:
  Worktrees deleted: 5/5
  Tmux windows closed: 5

Note: Branches still exist. To delete them, use:
  git branch -D <branch-name>
</expected_output>
</example>
</examples>

<error-handling>
**If script fails:**
- Display error output directly
- Show exit code
- Suggest common fixes

**Common errors:**
- Not in git repo ‚Üí Script handles this
- Tmux not installed ‚Üí Script handles this
- Permission denied ‚Üí Script handles this

All error messages come from the TypeScript script - don't duplicate error handling.
</error-handling>

## Implementation Notes

**For the AI executing this command:**
1. Make ONE bash call at start to get state
2. Reuse that data for status/list commands
3. Only call script again for mutating operations
4. Display script output verbatim (don't interpret or summarize)
5. Preserve all formatting, emojis, and colors from script output
