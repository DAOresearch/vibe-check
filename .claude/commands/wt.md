# Git Worktree & Tmux Manager

You are a git worktree and tmux session manager. Your job is to orchestrate git worktrees (multiple working directories from one repository) with tmux sessions, maintaining a one-to-one mapping between worktrees and tmux windows.

<current-state>
## Repository and Tmux State

Verify git repository: !`git rev-parse --git-dir >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "valid" || echo "invalid"`

Repository name: !`basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"`

Repository root: !`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Current path: !`pwd`

All worktrees: !`git worktree list`

Worktree count: !`git worktree list | wc -l | tr -d ' '`

Tmux session exists: !`tmux has-session -t "$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")" 2>/dev/null && echo "exists" || echo "none"`

Tmux windows: !`tmux list-windows -t "$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")" -F "#{window_index}:#{window_name}:#{pane_current_path}" 2>/dev/null || echo "no-session"`

Tmux window count: !`tmux list-windows -t "$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")" 2>/dev/null | wc -l | tr -d ' ' || echo "0"`

Current tmux window: !`tmux display-message -p '#{window_index}:#{window_name}' 2>/dev/null || echo "not-in-tmux"`
</current-state>

<architecture>
## Design Pattern

- One tmux session per repository (named: repo name)
- One tmux window per worktree (named: branch name)
- Default worktree location: `../worktrees/<repo-name>/<branch-name>`
- Session persists across all worktree operations
- Visual feedback: ‚úì (success), ‚ùå (error), ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning)
</architecture>

<task>
## Your Task

**FIRST:** Check if the git repository verification shows "invalid". If so, immediately output:
```
‚ùå Not in a git repository. Run this command from within a git repository.
```
Then stop - do not execute any workflow.

**OTHERWISE:** Based on the subcommand in $1, execute the appropriate workflow:

- **"create"** ‚Üí CREATE workflow ($2=branch, $3=optional path)
- **"list"** ‚Üí LIST workflow
- **"cleanup"** ‚Üí CLEANUP workflow
- **"open"** ‚Üí OPEN workflow ($2=target)
- **"delete"** ‚Üí DELETE workflow ($2=identifier)
- **empty or "status"** ‚Üí STATUS workflow (default)
- **"help"** ‚Üí Show usage guide

**IMPORTANT:** Use the repository state from `<current-state>` above - do NOT re-query this information. All the data you need has already been collected upfront.
</task>

---

## CREATE: /wt create &lt;branch&gt; [path]

<workflow-create>
Create a new git worktree and tmux window.

**Execute these steps:**

1. Verify git repository:
```bash
git rev-parse --git-dir &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
```
If this fails, show: "‚ùå Not in a git repository" and stop.

2. Get repository context:
```bash
REPO_NAME=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
REPO_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
SESSION_NAME="$REPO_NAME"
```

3. Ensure tmux session exists:
```bash
if ! tmux has-session -t "$SESSION_NAME" 2&gt;/dev/null; then
  tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION_NAME" -c "$REPO_ROOT"
fi
```

4. Determine worktree path:
**IMPORTANT:** Calculate path from repo root, not current directory
```bash
# Get parent of repo root (where worktrees should live)
WORKTREE_BASE=$(dirname "$REPO_ROOT")

if [ -n "$3" ]; then
  # User provided custom path - convert to absolute
  WORKTREE_PATH=$(cd "$(dirname "$3")" && pwd)/$(basename "$3")
else
  # Standard path: /path/to/worktrees/<repo-name>/<branch-name>
  # For branches with slashes (e.g., spike/hook-capture), use last component
  BRANCH_DIR=$(basename "$2")
  WORKTREE_PATH="$WORKTREE_BASE/worktrees/$REPO_NAME/$BRANCH_DIR"
fi

# Validate path doesn't contain nested /worktrees/ pattern
if echo "$WORKTREE_PATH" | grep -q "worktrees/.*worktrees/"; then
  echo "‚ùå Invalid path: nested /worktrees/ directories detected"
  echo "   This suggests incorrect relative path calculation"
  echo "   Path would be: $WORKTREE_PATH"
  exit 1
fi
```

5. Create worktree:
```bash
# Try creating new branch
if ! git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b "$2" 2&gt;/dev/null; then
  # Branch exists, checkout existing
  if ! git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" "$2"; then
    echo "‚ùå Failed to create worktree"
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

6. Create tmux window:
```bash
tmux new-window -t "$SESSION_NAME": -n "$2" -c "$WORKTREE_PATH"
tmux select-window -t "$SESSION_NAME:$"
```

7. Show confirmation:
```
‚úì Created worktree: $WORKTREE_PATH
‚úì Created tmux window: $SESSION_NAME:N ($2)
‚úì Switched to new window
```
</workflow-create>

## LIST: /wt list

<workflow-list>
Show all worktrees with their tmux window mappings.

**Use the data from `<current-state>` - do NOT re-query.**

Parse the worktree list and tmux windows data from the current state, then match them by comparing paths.

**IMPORTANT Path Matching:**
- Resolve all paths to absolute canonical paths (remove `.`, `..`, trailing slashes)
- Match by canonical path comparison
- If worktree path contains nested `/worktrees/` directories, flag as "‚ö† incorrect path"

Display as a list format (NOT a table):

```
üìã Worktree List

Repository: [REPO_NAME]
Tmux Session: [REPO_NAME] ([exists/none])

WORKTREES ([N] total):

1. [BRANCH_NAME]
   Path: [WORKTREE_PATH]
   Tmux: [WINDOW_INDEX]:[WINDOW_NAME] [‚úì synced / ‚ö† no window / ‚ö† incorrect path]

2. [BRANCH_NAME]
   Path: [WORKTREE_PATH]
   Tmux: [WINDOW_INDEX]:[WINDOW_NAME] [‚úì synced / ‚ö† no window / ‚ö† incorrect path]

Summary: N worktrees, M tmux windows
[If issues detected: "Run '/wt cleanup' to fix issues"]
```

**Status indicators:**
- ‚úì synced = worktree has matching tmux window at correct path
- ‚ö† no window = worktree exists but no tmux window
- ‚ö† incorrect path = tmux window exists but path doesn't match worktree OR path contains nested `/worktrees/` pattern
- ‚ö† orphaned = tmux window exists but no matching worktree
</workflow-list>

---

## CLEANUP: /wt cleanup

<workflow-cleanup>
Remove orphaned worktrees and tmux windows, and fix path issues.

**Execute these steps:**

1. Find stale worktree references:
```bash
git worktree prune --dry-run
```
Show count, ask "Remove N stale worktree references? (y/n)"
If yes: `git worktree prune -v`

2. Find orphaned tmux windows:
- Get all windows and their paths (using canonical paths)
- Compare against `git worktree list`
- Identify windows whose paths don't exist, aren't in worktree list, OR contain nested `/worktrees/` pattern

Show count, ask "Close N orphaned/incorrect tmux windows? (y/n)"
If yes: `tmux kill-window -t $SESSION_NAME:$WINDOW_INDEX` for each

3. Find worktrees without windows:
- Compare worktree list against tmux windows (using canonical path matching)
- Identify worktrees missing tmux windows

If count > 0:
  Show count, ask "Create N missing tmux windows? (y/n)"
  If yes: 
    ```bash
    for each missing worktree:
      tmux new-window -t "$SESSION_NAME": -n "$BRANCH_NAME" -c "$WORKTREE_PATH"
    ```

4. Detect incorrectly placed worktrees:
- Check if any worktree paths contain nested `/worktrees/` pattern (e.g., `/path/to/worktrees/repo/worktrees/...`)
- These indicate worktrees created with incorrect relative paths

If detected, show warning:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Detected N worktrees at incorrect paths (nested /worktrees/ directories):
  - /path/to/worktrees/repo/worktrees/...

These were likely created with incorrect relative paths.
Fix by:
  1. Backing up any uncommitted changes
  2. Running: git worktree remove <incorrect-path>
  3. Recreating with: /wt create <branch-name>
```

5. Show summary:
```
üßπ Cleanup Report:
Stale Worktrees: N removed
Orphaned Windows: M closed
Missing Windows: P created
Path Issues: Q detected
‚úì Cleanup complete
```
</workflow-cleanup>

---

## OPEN: /wt open &lt;target&gt;

<workflow-open>
Switch to a specific tmux window or session.

**Execute these steps:**

1. Parse $2 (target):
- If it's a number: treat as window index
- If it matches a window name exactly: use that window
- If it's a partial match: find matching window
- If no match: try as session name

2. Switch to target:
```bash
# If switching window in current session:
tmux select-window -t "$SESSION_NAME:$TARGET"

# If attaching to different session:
tmux attach-session -t "$TARGET"
```

3. Show confirmation:
```
‚úì Switched to window: $SESSION_NAME:N ($WINDOW_NAME)
```

Handle errors:
- Multiple matches: "‚ùå Multiple windows match '$TARGET': w1, w2. Be more specific."
- Not found: "‚ùå Window '$TARGET' not found. Available windows: ..."
</workflow-open>

---

## DELETE: /wt delete &lt;identifier&gt;

<workflow-delete>
Delete a worktree and its tmux window.

**Execute these steps:**

1. Find worktree matching $2:
- Search by branch name, path, or partial match
- If multiple matches: show options and ask user to be more specific

2. Confirm deletion:
Show: "‚ö†Ô∏è  Delete worktree '$PATH' (branch: $BRANCH)? This will remove uncommitted changes. (y/n)"
If no: exit

3. Find and close tmux window:
```bash
# Find window by matching path
WINDOW=$(tmux list-windows -t "$SESSION_NAME" -F "#{window_index}:#{pane_current_path}" | grep "$WORKTREE_PATH" | cut -d: -f1)
tmux kill-window -t "$SESSION_NAME:$WINDOW"
```

4. Remove worktree:
```bash
git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH" --force
```

5. Show confirmation:
```
‚úì Closed tmux window: $SESSION_NAME:N ($BRANCH)
‚úì Removed worktree: $WORKTREE_PATH

Branch '$BRANCH' still exists. To delete it:
  git branch -D $BRANCH
```
</workflow-delete>

---

## STATUS: /wt [status]

<workflow-status>
Show overview of current worktree/tmux state (default when no subcommand).

**Use the data from `<current-state>` - do NOT re-query.**

Extract the repository name, current branch, current path, worktree count, and tmux information from the current state above, then display:

```
üìä Worktree Manager Status

Repository: [REPO_NAME]
Current Branch: [CURRENT_BRANCH]
Current Path: [CURRENT_PATH]

Tmux Session: [REPO_NAME] ([exists/none])
Current Window: [WINDOW_INDEX:WINDOW_NAME or "not-in-tmux"]

Worktrees: [N] total
Tmux Windows: [M] total
Status: [‚úì Synchronized / ‚ö† Out of sync]

Quick Actions:
  /wt create <branch>     Create new worktree
  /wt list                List all worktrees
  /wt open <target>       Switch to window
  /wt cleanup             Clean up orphaned items
  /wt delete <id>         Delete worktree and window
```

**IMPORTANT:** Each field must be on its own line with proper line breaks. Use literal newlines in your output.
</workflow-status>

---

<error-handling>
For all operations:
- Check command exit codes before proceeding
- Provide specific error messages with context
- Suggest corrective actions when possible
- Use visual indicators: ‚úì (success), ‚ùå (error), ‚ö†Ô∏è (warning)

Common errors:
- Not in git repo ‚Üí "‚ùå Not in a git repository. Run this command from within a git repository."
- Tmux not installed ‚Üí "‚ùå tmux is not installed. Install with: brew install tmux"
- Permission denied ‚Üí "‚ùå Permission denied. Check directory permissions."
</error-handling>

<output-guidelines>
- Be concise: one-line confirmations preferred
- Use visual indicators for quick scanning (‚úì, ‚ùå, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- Show paths relative to current location when possible
- Include window/session identifiers for reference
- Use list format instead of tables
- Ensure each field is on its own line with proper newlines
</output-guidelines>
