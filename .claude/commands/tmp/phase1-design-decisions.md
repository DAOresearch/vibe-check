# Phase 1: Design Decisions

**Purpose:** Make architectural decisions for the 5 critical design questions identified in the specification audit.

**Tracking Document:** `.claude/docs/vibecheck/design-decisions.md`

**Prerequisite:** Specification audit completed (specification-audit-report.md exists)

---

## Your Task

1. **Read the audit report:**
   - `.claude/docs/vibecheck/specification-audit-report.md` (section: Questions for Clarification)

2. **Create the design decisions tracking document:**
   - File: `.claude/docs/vibecheck/design-decisions.md`
   - Format each of the 5 questions with:
     - Question statement
     - Context (where in spec this appears)
     - Options (A, B, C if applicable)
     - Recommendation with rationale
     - Space for final decision
     - Impact analysis (what changes in spec)

3. **Present the questions to the user for discussion:**
   - For each question, explain:
     - Why this decision matters
     - Trade-offs of each option
     - Your recommendation and why
   - Wait for user input on each question

4. **Document decisions:**
   - Update the tracking doc with user's final decisions
   - Add rationale for each decision
   - Note which spec sections will be affected

5. **Create dependency map:**
   - Show which spec fixes depend on which design decisions
   - This feeds into Phase 2

## Success Criteria

- [ ] design-decisions.md created with all 5 questions documented
- [ ] All 5 questions have final decisions recorded
- [ ] Rationale documented for each decision
- [ ] Impact on spec sections identified
- [ ] User has approved all design decisions
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (spec fixes)

---

## Output Format

Provide:
1. The created design-decisions.md file path
2. Summary of all 5 decisions in a table
3. List of spec sections that need updating based on decisions
4. Confirmation that Phase 2 can begin
