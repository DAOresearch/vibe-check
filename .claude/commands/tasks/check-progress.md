# Understanding Progress Tracking

The Vibe-Check project tracks progress at multiple levels:

**Overall Progress** = (Completed Tasks / Total Tasks) √ó 100%
**Phase Progress** = (Completed Tasks in Phase / Total Tasks in Phase) √ó 100%

**Task States**:
- ‚úÖ Complete: Task fully implemented, tested, and documented
- üöß In Progress: Task started but not complete
- üîú Not Started: Task pending
- ‚ùå Blocked: Task cannot start due to dependencies

**Files to Read**:
- `.claude/tasks/PROGRESS.md` - Master checklist with all tasks
- `.claude/tasks/TEST_MATRIX.md` - Test coverage by component
- `.claude/tasks/RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` - Current risk status
- Current phase OVERVIEW.md - Phase-specific status
</progress_definitions>

<completion_calculation_algorithm>
# How to Calculate Completion Percentage

**Algorithm**:
1. Parse PROGRESS.md and count checkbox states
2. Count total tasks: `total = count(all checkboxes in PROGRESS.md)`
3. Count completed: `completed = count(checkboxes with [x] or ‚úÖ)`
4. Calculate: `overall_pct = (completed / total) * 100`
5. Round to nearest integer

**Per-Phase Calculation**:
1. Identify phase sections in PROGRESS.md (## Phase N: ...)
2. For current phase:
   - Count tasks under phase heading
   - Count completed tasks (marked [x] or ‚úÖ)
   - Calculate: `phase_pct = (phase_completed / phase_total) * 100`

**Example**:
- PROGRESS.md has 80 total checkboxes
- 12 are marked [x] or ‚úÖ
- Overall: (12/80) * 100 = 15%
- Current phase (Phase 1) has 10 tasks, 6 complete
- Phase 1: (6/10) * 100 = 60%
</completion_calculation_algorithm>

## Your Task

You are helping the user check the current status of the Vibe-Check implementation project. This involves reading progress trackers, calculating completion percentages, identifying what's done and what's next, and surfacing any blockers.

**Why this matters**: Regular progress checks keep the team aligned, identify blockers early, celebrate completed work, and ensure momentum toward project goals.

**Expected output**:
- Current phase and completion percentages (overall + phase-specific)
- List of recently completed tasks
- List of in-progress tasks
- Next recommended tasks to work on
- Any blockers or issues
- Test coverage summary
- Recommendations for next steps

## Process

First, read and analyze all progress tracking files:

1. **Read progress files** in parallel:
   - Read PROGRESS.md (master task list)
   - Read TEST_MATRIX.md (test coverage)
   - Read RISK_ASSESSMENT.md (risk status)
   - Read current phase OVERVIEW.md

2. **Calculate completion percentages**:
   - Parse PROGRESS.md for all checkboxes
   - Count total tasks and completed tasks
   - Calculate overall completion: `(completed / total) * 100`
   - Identify current phase from PROGRESS.md header
   - Calculate current phase completion: `(phase_completed / phase_total) * 100`

3. **Identify completed tasks**:
   - Quote tasks marked ‚úÖ or [x] in PROGRESS.md
   - Group by phase if helpful
   - Focus on recently completed (last session or two)

4. **Identify in-progress tasks**:
   - Look for tasks marked üöß or partially complete
   - Check SESSION_LOG/ directory for active sessions
   - Estimate percentage complete for in-progress tasks if possible

5. **Identify next tasks**:
   - Find first unchecked task in current phase
   - Validate dependencies are met
   - Suggest 1-3 tasks to prioritize
   - Consider parallelization opportunities

6. **Check for blockers**:
   - Read "Blockers & Issues" section in PROGRESS.md
   - Check RISK_ASSESSMENT.md for high-risk items
   - Look for dependency violations (Ring 2 started before Ring 1 complete)

7. **Summarize test coverage**:
   - Read TEST_MATRIX.md
   - Report overall coverage percentage
   - Compare against targets (kernel ‚â•95%, supporting ‚â•90%, utilities ‚â•85%)
   - Flag any components below target

8. **Provide recommendations**:
   - Based on completion %, blockers, and next tasks
   - Suggest focus areas for current session
   - Estimate time to phase completion
   - Highlight risks or concerns

Use parallel tool execution: Read all tracking files simultaneously for speed.

üìä Vibe-Check Implementation Progress

**Current Status**:
- **Phase**: Phase 2 - Ring 1 (Core Systems) + Phase 3 (Early Start)
- **Overall**: 40% complete (32/80 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: 78% complete (14/18 tasks)
- **Phase 3**: 5% complete (1/20 tasks)

**Recently Completed** ‚úÖ:
- Phase 2: Storage System complete ‚úÖ
- Phase 2: Git Integration complete ‚úÖ
- Phase 2: AgentRunner implemented ‚úÖ
- Phase 3: vibeTest started (early)

**In Progress** üöß:
- Phase 2: Agent Execution System (67% done)
  - AgentRunner: ‚úÖ Complete
  - ContextManager: ‚ùå Not started (BLOCKER)
  - hooks/capture.ts: ‚úÖ Complete
  - hooks/processor.ts: ‚ùå Not started (BLOCKER)

- Phase 3: vibeTest.ts (20% done)
  - Started early (before Ring 1 complete) ‚ö†Ô∏è

**‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKERS DETECTED**:

**Blocker 1: Dependency Violation** (Critical)
- **Issue**: Phase 3 (vibeTest) started before Phase 2 (Ring 1) complete
- **Impact**: vibeTest depends on AgentRunner and ContextManager
- **Risk**: ContextManager not implemented yet
- **Resolution**:
  1. PAUSE work on vibeTest
  2. Complete ContextManager (Priority: Critical)
  3. Complete hooks/processor.ts (Priority: Critical)
  4. THEN resume vibeTest work

**Blocker 2: Hook Processing Incomplete** (High)
- **Issue**: hooks/processor.ts not started
- **Impact**: Cannot correlate tool calls, vibeTest cannot capture RunResult properly
- **Resolution**:
  1. Implement hooks/processor.ts (use Spike 3 learnings)
  2. Test with ContextManager
  3. Target: 2-3 days

**Next Steps** (Corrected Priority):
1. ‚ùå **STOP vibeTest work temporarily**
2. ‚úÖ **Implement ContextManager** (Critical - start NOW)
3. ‚úÖ **Implement hooks/processor.ts** (Critical - can parallel with ContextManager)
4. ‚úÖ **Complete Ring 1 integration session**
5. ‚úÖ **Then resume vibeTest** (after Ring 1 complete)

**Test Coverage**:
- Ring 1 (partial): 88% coverage (missing Agent components)
- Target for Ring 1: 90%

**Recommendation**:
Focus all resources on completing Ring 1 Agent Execution System before continuing Ring 2 work. The radial architecture requires Ring 1 to be fully complete before Ring 2 can proceed.

**Estimated Time to Unblock**: 2-3 days (complete Ring 1 Agent System)
</expected_output>

<reasoning>
This example shows a critical blocker: Phase 3 started before Phase 2 was complete, violating the radial dependency architecture. The output clearly identifies the violation, explains why it's a problem, and provides specific steps to resolve it. It emphasizes stopping Phase 3 work until Phase 2 is complete.
