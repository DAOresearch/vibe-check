## What is Vibe Check?

Vibe Check is a **dual-purpose platform** built on Vitest:

### 1. Automation Suite
- Run multi-step agent pipelines
- Orchestrate multiple agents with different tools
- Capture artifacts, metrics, and transcripts
- Get production-grade reporting on every run

### 2. Evaluation Framework
- Benchmark models, prompts, tools, and MCP servers
- Matrix test every configuration in parallel
- Track costs, tokens, duration, and quality
- Enforce quality gates with custom matchers and LLM judges

**Killer feature:** Production-grade **rich terminal + HTML reports** with costs, tokens, timelines, transcripts, todos, and artifacts‚Äîon every run.
