## Quick Start

Choose your path based on what you want to accomplish:

### Path 1: Automation

Build multi-stage agent pipelines with `vibeWorkflow`:

```typescript
import { vibeWorkflow, defineAgent } from '@dao/vibe-check';

vibeWorkflow('refactor pipeline', async (wf) => {
  const analysis = await wf.stage('analyze', {
    agent: defineAgent({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4' }),
    prompt: '/analyze codebase'
  });

  await wf.stage('fix', {
    agent: defineAgent({ model: 'claude-opus-4' }),
    prompt: '/apply fixes',
    context: analysis
  });
});
```

**Start here:** [First Automation Tutorial](/getting-started/first-automation/)

### Path 2: Evaluation

Benchmark models and enforce quality gates with `vibeTest`:

```typescript
import { vibeTest, defineAgent } from '@dao/vibe-check';

vibeTest('benchmark sonnet', async ({ runAgent, expect }) => {
  const result = await runAgent({
    agent: defineAgent({ model: 'claude-sonnet-4' }),
    prompt: '/refactor src/'
  });

  expect(result).toStayUnderCost(3.00);
  expect(result).toCompleteAllTodos();
});
```

## Tutorials

### Installation & Setup
**[Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation/)**

Learn how to install Vibe Check, configure Vitest, and set up your first test file.

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, basic TypeScript knowledge

---

### First Automation
**[Build Your First Pipeline](/getting-started/first-automation/)**

Create a multi-step automation pipeline that analyzes code and fixes issues.

**What you'll learn:**
- Define agents with different tool access
- Run agents sequentially in a pipeline
- Pass artifacts between steps
- Assert on completion and errors

**Time:** 10 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Installation complete

---

### First Evaluation
**[Benchmark Your First Agent](/getting-started/first-evaluation/)**

Compare two agent configurations (e.g., Haiku vs Opus) on the same task.

**What you'll learn:**
- Use matrix testing for benchmarking
- Compare costs and quality across models
- Use LLM judges for evaluation
- Read HTML reports with side-by-side results

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Installation complete

---

### Core Concepts
**[Understanding Vibe Check Concepts](/explanation/core-concepts/)**

Learn the key concepts and mental models: prompts, agents, results, matchers, judges, and the auto-capture system.

**What you'll learn:**
- How prompts, agents, and results work together
- The auto-capture system and lazy loading
- The role of matchers and judges
- vibeTest vs vibeWorkflow
- How reporting and isolation work

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** None (can read before installing)
