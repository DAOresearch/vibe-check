## Learning Path

### 1. Installation & Setup

Start by [installing vibe-check](/getting-started/installation/) in your project. This guide covers:

- Package installation with npm/yarn/bun
- Basic configuration
- Environment setup for Claude Code
- Verifying your installation

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, Claude Code CLI

---

### 2. Core Concepts

The [Quickstart guide](/getting-started/quickstart/) introduces you to:

- The dual API surface (`vibeTest` vs `vibeWorkflow`)
- Agent definitions and execution
- Auto-captured context (files, tools, git state)
- Basic assertions and matchers

**Time:** 5 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Installation complete

---

### 3. Testing Basics

Follow [Your First Test](/getting-started/first-test/) to learn:

- Writing assertions with custom matchers
- Inspecting file changes and tool calls
- Using LLM judges for quality evaluation
- Debugging failed tests with captured context

**Time:** 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Quickstart complete

---

### 4. Automation Workflows

Learn to [build workflows](/getting-started/first-automation/) that:

- Chain multiple agent stages together
- Pass cumulative context between stages
- Implement retry and loop patterns
- Handle errors gracefully

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Testing basics complete

---

### 5. Model Evaluation

Discover how to [evaluate and benchmark](/getting-started/first-evaluation/) agents:

- Matrix testing across models and configurations
- LLM-based quality evaluation with rubrics
- Cost analysis and optimization
- Comparing agent performance

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Testing and automation basics complete
