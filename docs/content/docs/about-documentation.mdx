This documentation follows the **[Diátaxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)**, a systematic approach to organizing technical documentation that makes it easier for you to find exactly what you need.

## The Four Types of Documentation

Diátaxis divides documentation into four distinct types, each serving a specific need:

```
                    PRACTICAL STEPS          THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE
                    ───────────────          ───────────────────
LEARNING        │   📚 TUTORIALS          │   💡 EXPLANATION
(Acquisition)   │   Learning-oriented     │   Understanding-oriented
                │   "Take me by hand"     │   "Help me understand"
                │                         │
────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────
WORKING         │   📖 HOW-TO GUIDES     │   📋 REFERENCE
(Application)   │   Problem-oriented      │   Information-oriented
                │   "Show me how"         │   "Tell me facts"
```

## 📚 Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)

**When you're learning and need guided practice.**

Tutorials are step-by-step lessons that teach you by doing. They're designed for beginners and provide a safe, controlled learning environment.

### In Vibe Check:
- **[Getting Started](/getting-started/)** - Installation, first automation, first evaluation
- **[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)** - Your first working example
- **[First Automation](/getting-started/first-automation/)** - Build a pipeline step-by-step
- **[First Evaluation](/getting-started/first-evaluation/)** - Benchmark models step-by-step

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Complete, working examples
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Expected outcomes at each step
- ✅ Safe to experiment
- ❌ Not for solving specific problems (see How-To Guides)

---

## 📖 How-To Guides (Problem-Oriented)

**When you have a specific problem to solve.**

How-to guides are practical recipes that assume you have baseline knowledge and help you accomplish specific tasks.

### In Vibe Check:
- **[Guides](/guides/)** - Organized by topic (automation, evaluation, agents, advanced)
- **[Recipes](/recipes/)** - Copy-paste patterns for common scenarios

**Example guides:**
- [Building Pipelines](/guides/automation/pipelines/) - Chain agents and pass artifacts
- [Model Benchmarking](/guides/evaluation/benchmarking/) - Compare model performance
- [Agent Configuration](/guides/agents/configuration/) - Configure models, tools, sources

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Goal-oriented
- ✅ Assumes familiarity with basics
- ✅ Focused on the task, not explanation
- ✅ Multiple approaches when relevant
- ❌ Not for learning fundamentals (see Tutorials)

---

## 📋 Reference (Information-Oriented)

**When you need accurate technical facts.**

Reference documentation provides precise, comprehensive information about functions, types, and configurations. It's dry, factual, and organized for quick lookup.

### In Vibe Check:
- **[API Reference](/api/)** - Complete TypeScript reference
  - [vibeTest](/api/vibetest/) - Test function signatures
  - [vibeWorkflow](/api/vibeworkflow/) - Workflow function signatures
  - [defineAgent](/api/defineagent/) - Agent configuration spec
  - [Matchers](/api/matchers/) - All custom matchers
  - [Types](/api/types/) - Complete type definitions

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Comprehensive and accurate
- ✅ Structured for lookup
- ✅ Technical precision
- ✅ No interpretation or explanation
- ❌ Not for understanding concepts (see Explanation)

---

## 💡 Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)

**When you want to understand "why" and "how it works."**

Explanation documentation provides background, context, and deeper understanding. It helps you move from working familiarity to deep comprehension.

### In Vibe Check:
- **[Explanation](/explanation/)** - Architecture and design
  - [Architecture Overview](/explanation/architecture/) - How Vibe Check works internally
  - Mental models (auto-capture, lazy loading, fixtures)
  - Design decisions (why Vitest, dual API, storage strategy)
  - Comparisons (when to use vibeTest vs vibeWorkflow)

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Conceptual understanding
- ✅ Background and context
- ✅ Examples and comparisons
- ✅ Discussion of alternatives
- ❌ Not a tutorial (see Tutorials)
- ❌ Not a how-to (see Guides)

## Why Diátaxis?

The Diátaxis framework solves a common problem: **different users need different things from documentation.**

- **New users** need hand-holding tutorials
- **Working users** need problem-solving guides
- **All users** need accurate reference material
- **Advanced users** need deep explanations

By separating these into distinct sections, you can:
1. **Find information faster** - Know exactly where to look
2. **Get the right level of detail** - No too-simple guides in reference, no too-complex explanations in tutorials
3. **Learn progressively** - Start with tutorials, graduate to guides, reference as needed

---

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding documentation:

1. **Identify the type** - Is this a tutorial, guide, reference, or explanation?
2. **Place it correctly** - Add to the appropriate section
3. **Follow the style** - Match the characteristics of that documentation type
4. **Cross-link wisely** - Link to other quadrants when users need to jump

**Example:**
- Tutorial mentions a concept? → Link to Explanation
- Explanation shows a pattern? → Link to How-To Guide
- How-To Guide uses a function? → Link to Reference
