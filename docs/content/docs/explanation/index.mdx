This section provides **understanding-oriented documentation** that explains how Vibe Check works internally. These docs are for developers who want to understand the design decisions, architecture, and internal mechanisms.

:::tip[Who Should Read This?]
- **Contributors** who need to understand internals to write code
- **Advanced users** debugging or optimizing their usage
- **Architects** evaluating Vibe Check for their projects
- **Curious developers** who want to learn from the design

## Architecture & Design

### [Architecture Overview](/explanation/architecture/)

Technical deep-dive into Vibe Check's internal design:
- **Capture → Process → Inject** architecture
- ContextManager class and RunBundle structure
- Hook integration with Claude Code
- File change detection and correlation
- Storage strategy (hybrid disk + thin meta)
- Vitest integration patterns

**Who needs this:** Contributors, advanced users, system architects

## Core Concepts

:::note[Coming Soon]
Deep-dives into core concepts are being written:
- **Auto-Capture System** - How execution context is automatically recorded
- **Lazy Loading Pattern** - Why and how file content is loaded on-demand
- **Fixture System** - How Vitest fixtures provide the magic
- **Reporter Architecture** - How terminal and HTML reports are generated
- **Matrix Testing** - How Cartesian products generate test combinations
:::

## Design Decisions

:::note[Coming Soon]
Documentation of key design decisions and trade-offs:
- **Why Vitest?** - Why not a custom test runner
- **Hybrid Storage** - Why disk bundles + thin metadata
- **Dual API** - Why both `vibeTest` and `vibeWorkflow`
- **Hook-Based Capture** - Why Claude Code hooks vs other approaches
