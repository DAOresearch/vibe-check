## Overview

Production agent automation requires careful orchestration, error handling, and state management. These guides cover:

- **Multi-stage workflows** - Chain agents together with cumulative context
- **Iteration patterns** - Retry, loop, and convergence strategies
- **Error resilience** - Recovery, fallbacks, and graceful degradation
- **State management** - Context sharing across workflow stages

## Guide Details

### [Building Workflows](/guides/automation/building-workflows/)

Create sophisticated multi-stage workflows that orchestrate multiple agents.

**You'll learn:**
- Defining workflow stages with `wf.stage()`
- Passing cumulative context between stages
- Accessing cross-stage data (files, tools, timeline)
- Composing complex pipelines

**Use cases:**
- Multi-step deployment pipelines
- Code generation → review → fix workflows
- Data processing pipelines
- Progressive refinement automation

**Key concepts:**
- Stage definitions and ordering
- Cumulative context accumulation
- Cross-stage data access
- Workflow composition

---

### [Loop Patterns](/guides/automation/loop-patterns/)

Implement retry logic, iterative refinement, and convergence testing.

**You'll learn:**
- Using `wf.until()` for conditional loops
- Implementing retry strategies
- Testing for convergence
- Iterative refinement patterns

**Use cases:**
- Retry failed operations with backoff
- Iterative code improvement
- Converge to quality thresholds
- Progressive enhancement workflows

**Key concepts:**
- Condition checking
- Loop termination strategies
- Max iteration limits
- State tracking across iterations

---

### [Error Handling](/guides/automation/error-handling/)

Build resilient workflows that handle failures gracefully.

**You'll learn:**
- Error detection and classification
- Recovery strategies
- Fallback mechanisms
- Graceful degradation patterns

**Use cases:**
- Fallback to simpler models on failure
- Retry with different prompts
- Skip failed stages with warnings
- Aggregate partial results

**Key concepts:**
- Try-catch patterns for stages
- Error classification
- Recovery decision trees
- State preservation on failure
