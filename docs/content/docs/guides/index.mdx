:::tip[üìñ How-To Guides - Problem-Oriented]
This section contains **practical how-to guides** for accomplishing specific tasks. Each guide assumes you have baseline knowledge (completed [Getting Started](/getting-started/)) and focuses on solving a particular problem.

**Looking for learning material?** See [Getting Started](/getting-started/) for step-by-step tutorials.
**Looking for API details?** See [API Reference](/api/) for function signatures.
**Want to understand "why"?** See [Explanation](/explanation/) for architecture and design decisions.

## Automation

Build multi-step agent pipelines and orchestrate workflows.

- **[Building Pipelines](/guides/automation/pipelines/)** - Chain agents, pass artifacts, handle errors
- **[Multi-Agent Orchestration](/guides/automation/orchestration/)** - Coordinate multiple agents with different tools
- **[Error Handling & Debugging](/guides/automation/error-handling/)** - Debug failed runs, inspect transcripts

---

## Evaluation

Benchmark models, track costs, and enforce quality standards.

- **[Model Benchmarking](/guides/evaluation/benchmarking/)** - Compare model performance and cost
- **[Matrix Testing](/guides/evaluation/matrix-testing/)** - Test multiple configurations in parallel
- **[Quality Gates](/guides/evaluation/quality-gates/)** - Use matchers and LLM judges

---

## Agents

Configure agents with models, tools, sources, and system prompts.

- **[Agent Configuration](/guides/agents/configuration/)** - Complete guide to defineAgent()
- **[Project Sources](/guides/agents/sources/)** - temp, local, git sources with isolation
- **[Tools & MCP](/guides/agents/tools/)** - Tool allowlisting and MCP server integration
- **[System Prompts](/guides/agents/system-prompts/)** - Presets and custom instructions

---

## Advanced

Deep dives into isolation, cost tracking, CI/CD, and extensibility.

- **[Worktree Isolation](/guides/advanced/isolation/)** - How isolation works, cleanup policies
- **[Cost Optimization](/guides/advanced/cost-optimization/)** - Track costs, set budgets, optimize runs
- **[CI/CD Integration](/guides/advanced/ci-cd/)** - Run in CI, publish reports, gate merges
- **[Custom Matchers](/guides/advanced/custom-matchers/)** - Write your own quality assertions
