## Testing

Learn patterns for writing effective tests and assertions.

### [Reactive Watchers](/guides/testing/reactive-watchers/)
Implement fail-fast assertions with `AgentExecution.watch()` to catch issues early during agent runs.

**Topics:** Real-time monitoring, partial results, early termination, error detection

### [Cumulative State](/guides/testing/cumulative-state/)
Track and aggregate state across multiple agent runs for comprehensive testing scenarios.

**Topics:** Multi-run tracking, state aggregation, cross-run analysis, data persistence

### [Custom Matchers](/guides/testing/custom-matchers/)
Use all available matchers for files, tools, quality checks, and cost constraints.

**Topics:** File matchers, tool matchers, quality matchers, cost matchers, matcher chaining

### [Matrix Testing](/guides/testing/matrix-testing/)
Generate Cartesian product tests to benchmark multiple models and configurations.

**Topics:** Test generation, model comparison, configuration matrices, performance analysis

---

## Automation

Build production-ready agent workflows and pipelines.

### [Building Workflows](/guides/automation/building-workflows/)
Create multi-stage workflows that orchestrate complex agent interactions.

**Topics:** Stage definitions, cumulative context, cross-stage data sharing, pipeline composition

### [Loop Patterns](/guides/automation/loop-patterns/)
Implement retry logic and iterative workflows using `until()` helpers.

**Topics:** Retry strategies, convergence testing, iterative refinement, condition checking

### [Error Handling](/guides/automation/error-handling/)
Build resilient workflows with comprehensive error handling strategies.

**Topics:** Error recovery, graceful degradation, fallback strategies, error reporting

---

## Evaluation

Evaluate and benchmark agent quality systematically.

### [Using Judges](/guides/evaluation/using-judge/)
Leverage LLM-based evaluation to assess agent output quality.

**Topics:** Judge configuration, rubric application, scoring systems, quality gates

### [Writing Rubrics](/guides/evaluation/rubrics/)
Design effective rubrics for consistent and reliable evaluation.

**Topics:** Rubric structure, criterion design, scoring scales, best practices

### [Benchmarking](/guides/evaluation/benchmarking/)
Compare models, configurations, and prompts with systematic benchmarking.

**Topics:** Performance metrics, cost analysis, model comparison, regression detection

---

## Advanced

Master advanced features and optimization techniques.

### [MCP Servers](/guides/advanced/mcp-servers/)
Integrate Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced agent capabilities.

**Topics:** MCP configuration, server integration, tool availability, context management

### [Cost Optimization](/guides/advanced/cost-optimization/)
Reduce costs while maintaining quality through strategic optimizations.

**Topics:** Token reduction, model selection, prompt optimization, caching strategies

### [Bundle Cleanup](/guides/advanced/bundle-cleanup/)
Manage artifact storage and implement cleanup policies.

**Topics:** Retention policies, storage management, cleanup strategies, disk usage

### [Multi-Modal Prompts](/guides/advanced/multi-modal-prompts/)
Use text, images, and files in your agent prompts effectively.

**Topics:** Image prompts, file attachments, mixed content, format handling
