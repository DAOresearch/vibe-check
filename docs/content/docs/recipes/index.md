Recipes are **working code examples** you can copy and adapt. Each recipe solves a specific problem and includes complete, runnable code.

---

## Automation Recipes

Build agent pipelines and orchestrate multi-step workflows.

### [Analyze → Fix Pipeline](/recipes/automation/analyze-fix-pipeline/)
Run a read-only analysis agent, then a separate fix agent with write access.

**Use case:** Separate concerns (analysis vs modification), validate tool restrictions

---

### [Multi-Agent Review](/recipes/automation/multi-agent-review/)
Coordinate multiple specialized agents (security, performance, tests) for comprehensive review.

**Use case:** Parallel reviews with different expertise, aggregate results

---

### [Progressive Tool Access](/recipes/automation/progressive-tool-access/)
Start with restricted tools, grant more access based on results.

**Use case:** Safety-first automation, incremental permissions

---

## Evaluation Recipes

Benchmark models, compare configurations, and track cost-quality tradeoffs.

### [Model Comparison](/recipes/evaluation/model-comparison/)
Compare Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus on the same task with cost and quality metrics.

**Use case:** Find optimal model for your use case, balance cost vs quality

---

### [Cost-Quality Tradeoff](/recipes/evaluation/cost-quality-tradeoff/)
Systematically measure cost vs quality across model tiers.

**Use case:** Budget optimization, identify diminishing returns

---

### [Tool Safety Testing](/recipes/evaluation/tool-safety-testing/)
Verify read-only agents never write files, enforce tool allowlists.

**Use case:** Security validation, compliance requirements

---

## How to Use Recipes

1. **Find a recipe** that matches your problem
2. **Copy the code** into your test file
3. **Adapt** to your specific use case (change prompts, agents, assertions)
4. **Run** with `bun test` or `npm test`
