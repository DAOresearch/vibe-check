Recipes are **working code examples** you can copy and adapt. Each recipe solves a specific problem and includes complete, runnable code.

## Automation Recipes

Build agent pipelines and orchestrate multi-step workflows.

:::note[Coming Soon]
Automation recipes are currently being developed. Check back soon for working examples of:
- **Analyze → Fix Pipeline** - Separate read-only analysis from write operations
- **Multi-Agent Review** - Coordinate specialized agents for comprehensive review
- **Progressive Tool Access** - Incremental permissions based on results
:::

---

## Evaluation Recipes

Benchmark models, compare configurations, and track cost-quality tradeoffs.

:::note[Coming Soon]
Evaluation recipes are currently being developed. Check back soon for working examples of:
- **Model Comparison** - Compare Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus with metrics
- **Cost-Quality Tradeoff** - Measure cost vs quality across model tiers
- **Tool Safety Testing** - Verify read-only agents and enforce allowlists

## How to Use Recipes

1. **Find a recipe** that matches your problem
2. **Copy the code** into your test file
3. **Adapt** to your specific use case (change prompts, agents, assertions)
4. **Run** with `bun test` or `npm test`
